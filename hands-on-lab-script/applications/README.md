# Applications

The following applications will be deployed:

* Lab03: [R Shiny workloads](r-shiny.md)
* Lab04: [Machine learning/Artificial Inteligence workloads](ml.md)
* Lab05: [Training workloads](training.md)
* Lab06: [Computing workloads](pi.md)

## Notebooks

The first notebooks were provided by [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) but nowadays notebooks are commonly being used by the community. They have become a standard:

* [iPython notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html)
* [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (the iPython notebook successor)
* [R notebooks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html)
* [Apache Zeppelin notebooks](https://zeppelin.apache.org/)
* [Spark notebooks](http://spark-notebook.io/)

In these hands-on labs we will only use **Jupyter notebooks** but we could have used any of the above technologies.
