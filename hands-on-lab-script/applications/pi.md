# Lab04: Computing workloads

We can use **OCP** to run non-interactive jobs. For instance pure computing jobs.

In this lab we are going to run a job that computes **Pi** with the accuracy you want (bare in mind that this lab is a 2-hour lab). After computing **Pi** a file will be stored in **Red Hat Ceph Storage** so you can get the result.

You can validate the results using [Pi constant generator](https://www.browserling.com/tools/pi-digits).
