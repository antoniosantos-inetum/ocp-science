# Training workloads

It is quite common to use notebooks to teach about diferent subjects.

As an example you will deploy a pod containing several Jupyter notebooks to learn about the [Navier-Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations).

These Jupyter Notebooks have been taken from [Lorena Barba github repository](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython)
